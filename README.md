# Hack4cause 2019 Planning
thanks for visiting the Hack4cause 2019 Planning Repo for tech mentors.  We're glad you are here :tada:

[Hack4Cause](https://hackforacause.org) is an annual event in Eugene where the tech community comes together to address civic challenges, build service culture, and spend 48 hours IRL with shared purpose and hang out.

This repo is for Open Source leaders (or "Tech Mentors" in event-speak) that help maintain the digital side of the event.  So if you have skills with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/hack-4-cause-2019-plan/issues), general web skills with products like [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xRjBkKJdcy7zwZjOb2TE9VodJTeRgJNq), or [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inviLIdrtt72RnYtB&inviteToken=6ad12622b4539a55702ae83d4e05c8e4def7e2c71d0f96ad53858ababe3afc78) we'd love you have you contributing.

There are lots of ways to help without actually attending the event.  See the [Onboarding Doc]https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/hack-4-cause-2019-plan/blob/master/team-onboarding.md) for full details on how to get involved.
