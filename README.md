# Hack4cause 2019 Planning
Thanks for visiting the Hack4cause 2019 Planning Repo for tech volunteers.  We're glad you are here :tada:

### The purpose of this repo is to collaborate on the current hack and serve as a template for the tech side of future hacks.

## What's happening?
[Hack4Cause](https://hackforacause.org) is an annual event in Eugene where the tech community comes together to address civic challenges, build service culture, and spend the weekend IRL with shared purpose and having fun hanging out.

## Who's the intended audience? 
This repo is for [tech-volunteers](docs/tech-volunteer-onboarding.md) that include [tech-mentors](docs/tech-mentor-onboarding.md) at the event, [repo-wranglers](docs/repo-wrangler-onboarding.md) that help maintain digital side of the event, [technical judges](/docs/tech-judge-onboarding) who help on the last day, and [AV Geeks](docs/av-geek-onboarding.md) who make the lights and sounds happen.  If you have skills with [GitHub](https://github.com/Hack4Eugene), general web skills with products like [Slack](http://hack4cause.slack.com), and Google Docs, we'd love to have you contributing!

## How can I help?
There are lots of ways to help before and during the event.  The start by [getting a ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-for-a-cause-2019-registration-58823596962) and selecting a volunteer option.  Then you can [Join the Slack](https://publicslack.com/slacks/hack4cause/invites/new) and look for the **#volunteers** channel.
