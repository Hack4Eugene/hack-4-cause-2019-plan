### Tech Mentor
You'll help folks with light coding tasks, getting set up in github and generally being helpful.

### Tech Judge
Show up Saturday at 11am and make sure teams checked into the repo and the code looks semi-reasonable by noon.

### Open Source Wrangler
You can get started before the event.  There are issues to be completed (above) and slack channels a repo to be built.  You are part of the pre-event and logistics, being around on friday is great too.  Stay the whole weekend if you like.

### AV Geeks
Responsible for setting up the projector, screen, audio cables, maybe even powerstrips, etc.  You can help teams get interviewed, prep for demos if needed.
