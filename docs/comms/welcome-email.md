# Welcome email

Hi [Name],

I'm one of the tech-volunteer wranglers for the event.

Please join the rest of the tech-volunteers in the #tech-mentors channel [in the slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/hack4cause/inviter) so we can get to know you!

We have a [pretty swell onboarding doc](https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/hack-4-cause-2019-plan/blob/master/docs/tech-volunteer-onboarding.md) to bring you up to speed as well as [a handy onboarding form](https://forms.gle/Hy4qQnLnLhmhgDi9A) to help match your talents to the needs of the participants.

We have a nerdy, and pretty comprehensive planning repo started: https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/hack-4-cause-2019-plan 

Please feel free to hit me up directly if you have questions.

Regards,
[Name]
