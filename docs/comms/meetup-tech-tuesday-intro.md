Hack4Cause is in two short weeks and teams are forming, volunteers are volunteering and there's an electricity in the air.  What a magical time to be alive! https://hackforacause.org/

Sit down with some of the folks making the event happen: Tech mentors, challenge sponsors, team leaders, and participants (like yourself?).  

Launching a civic project takes a diverse team that include designers, product owners, and good communicators.  So even if you don't identify as a "hacker" Hack4Cause needs you!
