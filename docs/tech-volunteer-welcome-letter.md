### Welcome Technical Volunteers! :tada:

Thank you so much for offering your time and energy for the 2019 Hack for a Cause. It's going to be a remarkable weekend, and we truly appreciate your help.

If you haven’t received an invitation to the Hack for a Cause Slack, please [get your invite here](https:/communityinviter.com/apps/hack4cause/inviter). Be sure to find the #tech-mentors and #volunteers channel once you're on the Hack for a Cause Slack, as that is where a most of the communication during the event will happen.

Please sign up for [shifts on this sheet](https://techoregon-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1ldCT39cDgeOLN0yQlAHfOQJpEKPMUiKlNWGbrGreeLw-1452232196&key=YAMMID-03975209&link=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1gWAtl473EZyGNTURBP1VW96r7YM5atMRPAdKtMPXwDc%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing). This is a comprehensive volunteer sign up sheet and includes non technical and technical volunteers. Roles for Tech Mentors are noted in the task column. Please add your name to the “Volunteer Name” column next to the shifts you would like.

Lastly, please be sure to bring any extra chargers for charging your devices.

Please let me know if you have any questions! Looking forward to a fantastic weekend!
