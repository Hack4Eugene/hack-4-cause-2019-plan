# Hack for a Cause Tech Judge Onboarding

Thanks for signing up for hack4cause as a Tech Judge. If you have not already, please fill out the [volunteer onboarding form](https://forms.gle/Hy4qQnLnLhmhgDi9A)

### What's our role?
As Tech Mentors we help participants navigate the more technical aspects of the event like Slack and GitHub as well as provide whatever specific advise we can in our area of expertise.  We can help with team formation and [onboarding](team-onboarding.md) 

#### Before the event
It's good to join in on the chatter at the **#tech-mentors** channel on the [Slack](http://hack4cause.slack.com) to get to know folks and maybe help with team formation in the **#team-formation** channel.

#### At the event
Most of your time will be spent at the event help teams with technical details. As teams pick challenges, hand then off to [Repo Wranglers](repo-wrangler-onboarding.md) to set up repos. Teams have wildly varied skill sets and it's great to help out the folks who need it.  Looks for folks who are struggling and lend a hand and don't be afraid to help in meaningful ways.  This hack is all about helping the civic orgs, so don't hold back.  That being said, try and spread your efforts around to those who need it the most.   

### Slack for Communications
We have a special **#tech-mentors** channel in the [Slack](http://hack4cause.slack.com) and If you don't have an account, you can [sign up](https://publicslack.com/slacks/hack4cause/invites/new).  Because we are using this for all comms at the event, we highly recommend install the mobile app on your phone during the event. 

### WHEN do I need to be on-site?
Pick a few blocks throughout the weekend that work with your schedule.  Friday night and Sunday morning are high activity times, Saturday can be a great time to dig-in.  Check [the schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gWAtl473EZyGNTURBP1VW96r7YM5atMRPAdKtMPXwDc/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
