# How it Works (aka "The Nitty Gritty" from opening night)

Welcome contributors to Hack for a Cause 2019.  My name is Mark Davis and I'm here to help us navigate some of the technical details of the event.

How about a big round of applause for all the nice folks who came to the open ceremonies? [clapping]

I'm going to use some technical jargon on you, not to confuse you, but because we are taking tech right now.  If words like "Fork the Repo", "Slack Channel", or "Submitting a Pull Request" sounds like "Mumbo Jumbo" to you, don't worry.  You are still in the right place! By the end of the weekend hopefully you'll be more comfortable with this tech jargon. 

This weekend is all about collaboration and the tools we are using for that are Slack and GitHub.  We've picked these tools because they are popular and free on the web. Everyone should have received an invitation to the slack when you signed up. If you are not on the slack now, check your email or go visit a tech mentor over at the mentor's table and they will be happy to assist.

Github is even easier, if you don't have an account yet, just visit http://github.com and sign-up.  

Collaboration is another theme this weekend and we encourage everyone to be on a team.  There is a #team-formation channel in the slack and we have folks here that can help place you on a team.  If you don't have a team and you would like one, please visit the mentors table and we'll work with you to get on a team.

If teams is not your thing, we can respect that, but if you are capable and willing to work with others, we feel you will have a richer experience.

Once you are on a team and have picked a challenge we will provide a GitHub repo for you to fork and get started.  Elect someone on your team to be your maintainer and have them visit the #repo-wrangler channel in the slack.  You can work in your forked repo all weekend and submit pull-requests on Sunday to be judged.  You must submit a pull request to be judged.  If that's a new concept to you, don't worry, that why we have tech mentors.

Very Important:  You must submit a pull request to get your code pulled into back into the official repo by Sunday. 

All of this information is published on GitHub and links to everything is in the Slack.

Before you get started I have two special announcements.

Announcement #1: MVP Studio is here to help by providing free hosting and devops for the weekend.  If your project qualifies, they will contact you and get you set up wih hosting on Google's cloud, slong with build services. So you can concentrate on your development work and skip some devops & hosting chores. Look for the MVP Studio table near the Mentors Table.

Announcement #2: If  you are new to Git, GitHub and/or Docker, we have an intro class that will start in 10 minutes right down the hall. This is a great way to get a jump on the weekend and I highly encourage you attend.

Thanks for you time!
