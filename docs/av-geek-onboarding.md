# Hack for a Cause AV Geek Onboarding

Thanks for signing up for hack4cause as an AV Geek. If you have not already, please fill out the [volunteer onboarding form](https://forms.gle/Hy4qQnLnLhmhgDi9A)

### What's our role?
As AV Geeks we run the projectors, audio, and other media.  There is a welcome party Friday Night with a keynote, stage, speakers etc.  Saturday is pretty quite on the AV side, but Sunday is a "Main Event" where we have an awards ceremony, show a movie of all the demos.  Our role is to make sure everything goes flawlessly.  No pressure right?

### Slack for Communications
We have a special **#tech-av-geeks** channel in the [Slack](http://hack4cause.slack.com) and If you don't have an account, you can [sign up](https://publicslack.com/slacks/hack4cause/invites/new).  Because we are using this for all comms at the event, we highly recommend install the mobile app on your phone during the event. 

### WHEN do I need to be on-site?
Friday night and Sunday morning are the busy times for AV Geeks see the [the schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gWAtl473EZyGNTURBP1VW96r7YM5atMRPAdKtMPXwDc/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
