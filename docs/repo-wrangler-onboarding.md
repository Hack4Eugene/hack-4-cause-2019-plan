# Hack for a Cause Repo Wrangler Onboarding

Thanks for signing up for hack4cause as a Repo Wrangler. If you have not already, please fill out the [volunteer onboarding form](https://forms.gle/Hy4qQnLnLhmhgDi9A)

### What's our role?
As Repo Wranglers we maintain the digital mirror-world for the event. That happens in GitHub and Slack. 

#### Before the event
There is work to do leading up to the event and you can [check out the issues list](https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/hack-4-cause-2019-plan/labels/Repo%20Wrangler) and dive in.  Check the #tech-repo-wrangler slack channel for more details.

#### At the event
As teams form they will pick a challenge(s) and we create a repo for them in the [Hack4Eugene org](https://github.com/Hack4Eugene) following the [team-onboarding](team-onboarding.md) steps. That results in a team slack channel, and team repo(s). Once the org repo is created we'll have the team fork the repo to do their work, and show them how to add collaborators.  On sunday, the teams must submit a pull-request back to us to get judged.  We can walk them thru that as well.

### Slack for Communications
We have a special **#tech-repo-wranglers** channel in the [Slack](http://hack4cause.slack.com) and If you don't have an account, you can [sign up](https://publicslack.com/slacks/hack4cause/invites/new).  Because we are using this for all comms at the event, we highly recommend install the mobile app on your phone during the event. 

### WHEN do I need to be on-site?
Friday night and Sunday morning are the busy times for Repo Wranglers see the [the schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gWAtl473EZyGNTURBP1VW96r7YM5atMRPAdKtMPXwDc/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
